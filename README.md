<h1  style="text-align:center">Filthy Critic Reviews</h1>

Scrape FilthyCritic and IMDB using Python and the Scrapy package.

This was phase 1 of a 3 part project of creating a Netflix-style clone of the current archive.

Why?

Because his current one is just....awful.

Many worse writers have much better sites, which is. Um. Also awful. 

Pt 2; set up back end using Ruby on Rails

Pt 3; set up front end using Angular

Pt 4; build site UX for mobile

Pt 5; Incorporate NgRx for persistant front end storage


### UPDATE;
My Netflix clone is complete, and can be currently viewed [here](https://thefilthycritic.herokuapp.com/flt).

That reminds me. Thanks, Netflix, for changing your UI, the same one that has remained mostly unchanged for a long time, right in the middle of my build. Thanks a bunch.

My clone is in a private repo but can be made available for code review purposes.
