<h1  style="text-align:center">Filthy Critic Reviews</h1>

This was a first-time attempt at scraping a web site using Python and the Scrapy package.

This was phase 1 of a 3 part project of creating a Netflix-style clone of the current archive.

Why?

Because his current one is just....awful.

Many worse writers have much better sites, which is. Um. Also awful. 

Pt 2; set up back end using Ruby on Rails

Pt 3; set up front end using Angular

## Original movie reviews
An excellent writer, but the FC character is coarse. Proceed advised...

### UPDATE;
My Netflix clone is complete, and can be currently viewed [here](https://ancient-basin-02315.herokuapp.com/). Please be aware that I am in the process of adding a 'sanitized' flag that replaces profanity with asterisks for the purpose of showcasing, but for now the content remains in its original filthy format, which is amusing but understandably not for everyone.
Also in process is the switching to a NgRx store so data is persistant, and also dynamically loading content (just like Netflix).

That reminds me. Thanks, Netflix, for changing your UI, the same one that has remained mostly unchanged for a long time, right in the middle of my build. Thanks a bunch.

My clone is in a private repo, but can be made available for code review purposes.
